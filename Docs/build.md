# Voltage processor build notes

This is a straightforward build. Since there are many panel components be sure to mount the panel on them before soldering them in place. Follow markings on PCB to connect the Molex connectors in correct order to the pots.

**Errata:** In the first run PCB, R7 is marked 4.7k. This is the value used in the MFOS design but I feel it gives too slow a minimum linear ramp. I recommend changing it to 47k. This value has been updated in the design files.
